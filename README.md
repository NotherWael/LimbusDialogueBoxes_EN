# Limbus Company Dialogue Boxes for Enemies & Identities!

This mod adds speech bubbles for all characters with battle voicelines!
(Including Untranslated Lines!)

## Installation
### When new story content or identities are added, please DISABLE the mod!!! and wait for a new update on this repository. (or else you would face issues like softlocking)
### Honestly I recommend you to not use this mod at all when there is new story content, so finish and enjoy the new story first and then use the mod!
1. Click **Code** → **Download ZIP** on this GitHub repository.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Navigate to:  
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Limbus Company\LimbusCompany_Data`
4. Drag the "Lang" folder from the extracted files into the "LimbusCompany_Data" folder.
5. Launch the game, click on "Select Custom Language," choose **SpeechDialogBoxesEN - NotherWael**, and restart the game.  
   - If it’s already selected, you can skip this step.
6. Enjoy the mod!

- To update, do the same steps and replace the old files with the new ones.
- To disable this mod, simply remove the Lang Folder and restart the game, or Select "-" in "Select Custom Langauge" at the start menu, and restart the game.

## Downsides & Issues
### This covers every battle voiceline in the game!!! So there might be a few characters missing lines if I've missed them, or if I've put the wrong voiceline ID, LMK if there are any!

- Some voicelines cannot display speech bubbles (e.g. Devyat's Polu or Full-stop Heathcliff in Overwatch state).  
- Font may not match the base game... but you can use your own custom fonts!  
- A green icon appears in the top-right corner during battle or story, indicates you are using a custom language mod.  
- Game start-up screen menu loading may take ages! (though it might be cause of my weak device... so i'm not sure) 
- Speech bubbles stay longer than they have to blocking visibility on skills during combat.
- Speech bubbles can end early because of the previous speech bubble before it.

## Known Voicelines That Do Not Work
- Devyat North Sinclair & Rodion All Poludnitsa Lines (Except the death ones cause i can fit it in with their death lines.)
- Overwatch Assignment Full-stop Heathcliff Combo Voicelines (He's not in battle, i could try to put it with FS Hong Lu's line, but his line has two variants so... i guess i'll put both!)
- N Corp Ryoshu and Yi Sang Skill Combo I Shall Fire // Anytime (Yeah the speech bubble just doesn't want to appear above her head at all, and yes it is the correct ID.)

## Credits
Goliath for telling me how to do this, they make a Russian translation custom langauge mod.
