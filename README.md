# Limbus Company Dialogue Boxes for Enemies & Identities!

This mod adds speech bubbles for all characters with battle voicelines!
(Including Untranslated Lines!)

## Installation
1. Click **Code** → **Download ZIP** on this GitHub repository.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Navigate to:  
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Limbus Company\LimbusCompany_Data`
4. Drag the "Lang" folder from the extracted files into the "LimbusCompany_Data" folder.
5. Launch the game, click on "Select Custom Language," choose **SpeechDialogBoxesEN - NotherWael**, and restart the game.  
   - If it’s already selected, you can skip this step.
6. Enjoy the mod!

- To disable this mod, simply remove the Lang Folder and restart the game, or Select "-" in "Select Custom Langauge" at the start menu, and restart the game.

## Downsides & Issues
- Some voicelines cannot display speech bubbles (e.g., Devyat's Polu or Full-stop Heathcliff in Overwatch state).  
- Font may not match the base game... but you can use your own custom fonts!  
- A green icon appears in the top-right corner indicates you are using a language mod.  
- Game start menu loading may take ages! (though might be cause of my weak device...) 
- Speech bubbles stay longer than they have to blocking visibility on skills during combat.
- Speech bubbles can end early because of the previous speech bubble before it.

- When new story content or identities are added, please DISABLE the mod!!! and wait for a new update on this repository.
(or else you would face issues)

### Honestly I recommend you to not use this mod at all when there is new story content, so finish and enjoy the story first and then use the mod!
