## Q&A
1. Is this bannable?
   - No! it's not, it's a custom language mod supported by PM, It just changes the localization files.
   - PM stated "Please note that, modification of the game client beyond the language text files, such as modification of client images or in-game data could be met with legal action or bans without prior warning"
   - This Mod only modifies langauge text files, so it's safe. [Link For the Notice](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1973530/view/533220039674824558)

2. How is this done?
   - Using the file `BattleSpeechBubbleDlg.json` you can add your own speech bubble text! (just needs the Voiceline ID and the text.)

## Downsides & Issues
### This covers every battle voiceline in the game!!! So there might be a few characters missing lines if I've missed them, or if I've put the wrong voiceline ID, LMK if there are any!

- Some voicelines cannot display speech bubbles (e.g., Devyat's Polu or Full-stop Heathcliff in Overwatch state).  
- Font may not match the base game... (like Mikodacs Font, not having Letter Spacing from the base game.) but you can use your own custom fonts!  
- A green icon appears in the top-right corner during battle or story, indicates you are using a custom language mod.  
- Game start-up screen menu loading may take ages! (though it might be cause of my weak device... so i'm not sure) 
- Speech bubbles stay longer than they have to blocking visibility on skills during combat.
- Speech bubbles can end early because of the previous speech bubble before it.
- Retreating IDs VLs move their Speech bubbles to the Substituted ID.

## Known Voicelines That Do Not Work
- Devyat North Sinclair & Rodion All Poludnitsa Lines (Except the death ones cause i can fit it in with their death lines.)
- Overwatch Assignment Full-stop Heathcliff Combo Voicelines (He's not in battle, i could try to put it with FS Hong Lu's line, but his line has two variants so... i guess i'll put both!)
- N Corp Ryoshu and Yi Sang Skill Combo I Shall Fire // Anytime (Yeah the speech bubble just doesn't want to appear above her head at all, and yes i did check if it's the correct ID.)
- Bloodfiend Trio Stage Turn Start VLs Don't Work Except for The Priest. (Their Skill VLs work tho... and some of these turn start voicelines do work on their respective stages.)
